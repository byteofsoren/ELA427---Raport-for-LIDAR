\section{INTRODUCTION}

In this project a lidar was designed and built. It was constructed as a stepper motor turning a Sharp distance sensor. The sensor data was collected using a myRIO from National Instruments. This report explains the function of the lidar in detail, in both software and hardware and wants to answer how fast the sensor can spin and still measure sufficiently, at what actual range the sensor can measure distance, the smallest object that the lidar can detect at what range, at what speed a 1dm wide object has to move along a tangent 20cm from the lidar not to be detected by it, and if any difference in material or colour will change the range at where an object can be detected.
