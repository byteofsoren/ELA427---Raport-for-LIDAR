\section{INTRODUCTION}

In this project a lidar was designed and build. It was constructed as a stepper motor turning a Sharp distance sensor. The sensor data was collected using a myRIO from National Instruments. The questions that this report wants to answer are how fast the sensor can spin and still measure sufficiently, at what actual range the sensor can measure distance, smallest object that the lidar can detect,
