The measurement for this LIDAr was done by measuring the distance between  the sensor and an target, both rotating and while standstill (static) for to acquire the necessary data. Figure \ref{fig:testSetUp} describes how the test set up was done.

  \caption{The LIDAR had the construction with an slip ring to allow free passage of the cable without being twinned. Therefore it used 2 3D printed cogs to transfer the rotation from the motor to the sensor. The lower circle describe the cog that was connected to the motor whiles the top one with the sensor describe the cog that had an slip ring in it. There are also an target to the bottom left, how ever the distance is not up to scale hear for spacing reason.}
