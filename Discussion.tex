The data sheet specifies the sensor range at 10-80cm but as seen from result this sensor is not performing on close to that level even when not rotating. This is due to the specific sensor being that bad and others tested behaved better but redoing all calibration and testing would have been to time consuming.\newline
Some of the problems with ghosting and hard to read values in the high speed could on first thought be helped by running it slower. When slowing the motor down it slows down a bit on each step and with the small gap with the helix gear introduces a lot of shaking. So by slowing down the motor a bit would lead to even worse data and the only solution is to slow it down at least 10-20 times and loosing all the speed.
