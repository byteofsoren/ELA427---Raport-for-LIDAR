The rotation speed of the sensor ended up at 0,8sec per lap (75rpm) at its best. 
Sensor actual range is limited to 10-42cm stopped and 15-30cm when rotating.
The minimum speed a 1dm object can tangent (in a straight line) the sensor at 20cm is 0.8m/s. This is when the object is following the sensor rotation and the sensor have to do more than a full turn to see the object
Smallest object (when rotating) is 0,5cm wide at 15cm, 1cm wide object at 20cm and 1dm wide at 30cm
When rotating there is no difference on colour, blank/matt or material difference, it is equally shitty
